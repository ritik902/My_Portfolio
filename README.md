I'm a Software Engineer by training from the Vidya College of Engineering. I've completed my PG-DBDA from CDAC Pune. In my free time, I continuously strive to enhance my programming and machine learning skills. Outside of coding, I have a passion for song editing, especially in LoFi style, as well as observing, exercising, traveling, and creating content for my YouTube channel.
